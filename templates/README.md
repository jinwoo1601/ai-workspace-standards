# AI Workspace Templates

![Template Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.5.3-blue)

This directory contains template variants for scaffolding new AI-assisted projects.
Select a variant when running `bun scripts/new-project.ts <name> --variant <variant>`.

```

**How it works:** When scaffolding a new project, the script first copies `templates/common/` (shared infrastructure), then overlays the selected variant (variant-specific files override common files).

**Country-scoped skills:** `k-law`, `k-dart`, and `k-kosis` are registered as KR-scoped in the `country_scoped_assets` section of `docs/workspace-schema.json` and are deployed only to projects scaffolded with target country `KR` (`--country KR`); region-neutral projects exclude them. See `common/docs/country-profiles.md` and ADR-0057 (`docs/adr/0057-country-profile-mechanism.md`).

## Phase 1, 2 & 3 Advancements

The following 2026 Q3–Q4 roadmap enhancements have been integrated across template variants:

- **`generate-ide-rules.ts`**: Automatically generates `.cursorrules` and `.clauderules` context rules during scaffolding to sync IDE coding agents with project context (`co-develop`).
- **`zod-contract-gate`**: Mandates Zod runtime schema validation across internal API contract boundaries in `co-develop`.
- **`swe-solve`**: Autonomous 4-stage problem-solving workflow (Ingest & Inspect → Localization & Plan → Mutation & Test → Review & PR) in `co-develop`.
- **`compile-tokens.ts`**: Compiles `tokens.json` design tokens to CSS custom properties and TypeScript types in `co-design`.
- **`accessibility-audit`**: Automated WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility evaluation using axe-core in `co-design`.
- **`mece-logic-auditor`**: Structural MECE issue tree auditor with ME/CE/Logic scorecards in `co-consult`.
- **`presenter-mode`**: Dual-window HTML5 presenter display with BroadcastChannel synchronization in `co-deck`.
- **`render-pdf-deck.ts`**: Playwright-based paged-media presentation PDF renderer supporting CSS `@page` print rules in `co-deck`.
- **`ecs-core.ts`**: Zero-dependency 150-line TypeScript Entity Component System core engine in `co-game`.
- **`sound-synth`**: Web Audio API procedural retro 8-bit sound effect generator (`jsfxr`) in `co-game`.
- **`stride-threat-matrix`**: Automated STRIDE threat modeling template with DREAD risk scoring in `co-security`.
- **`sarif-exporter`**: Exports security findings in SARIF v2.1.0 format for GitHub PR security checks in `co-security`.
- **`md-to-ooxml.ts`**: Markdown to native Microsoft Office OOXML (`.docx` / `.xlsx`) compiler script in `co-work`.
- **`standup-synthesizer`**: Automated 24-hour daily standup digest synthesizer in `co-work`.


## Usage

```bash
# Default (co-develop)
bun scripts/new-project.ts my-project

# Explicit variant
bun scripts/new-project.ts my-project --variant co-design

# Specify platform and version tag
bun scripts/new-project.ts my-project --variant co-develop --platform both --version 0.5.3
```

### Automation & Testing Scripts (templates/common/scripts)

Scaffolded projects inherit shared automation scripts from `templates/common/scripts/`:

- **`dev-sync.ts` (v1.5.0)**: Full development sync pipeline (`bun run dev-sync "feat: msg"` or `--body-file <path>`). Includes pre-flight markdown link validation gate (`bun scripts/validate-docs-links.ts`), session logging, MEMORY.md indexing, CHANGELOG check, audit gate, sensitive file detection, git commit/push, and GitHub PR creation.
- **`test-runner.ts` (v1.1.0)**: Test suite runner (`bun scripts/test-runner.ts [suite] [flags]`). Supports `unit`, `integration`, `scenarios`, and `scripts` suites with parallel execution (`--parallel`/`--sequential`), worker pool concurrency control (`--concurrency <n>`), per-test timeouts (`--timeout <ms>`), and isolated worker temp directories (`TEST_TEMP_DIR`).

## Shared File Sync Rule

Some files are shared between the workspace and templates:
- `.claude/commands/meeting.md` ↔ `templates/co-develop/.claude/commands/meeting.md`

When the workspace version changes, manually sync to the template variant:
```bash
cp .claude/commands/meeting.md templates/co-develop/.claude/commands/meeting.md
bun scripts/validate-templates.ts  # confirm no drift
```

## Version Policy

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full history.

- **Major** bump: agent dispatch model changes
- **Minor** bump: new agents, new variants going stable, structural section changes
